          Everyday for the past few weeks, I sat behind my laptop, switching
          between InDesign, Illustrator and Chrome. I sipped some tea in the
          morning, some more tea in the afternoon — and, oh yes — food,
          sometimes. Yet, despite the monotony, everyday was different: the
          process of identifying that one field of interest to propose,
          ruthlessly going over it again and again until it was convincing
          enough, research and more research, putting things together, working
          on the sketches. The research process felt exhausting. Pouring over
          papers and books and yet trying to stay on the right track without
          getting carried away and influenced by the many amazing and inspiring
          works by designers of old.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Once the research took shape, I spent a lot of time ransacking books
          and the Internet for beautiful and compelling artworks to back my
          proposal.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          I downloaded a bunch of images, added them to the research document,
          moved along only to come back and take a second look and reject them
          all. Rise, rinse and repeat. The satisfaction of finding the right
          words and images to express your ideas is an underrated pleasure.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          It’s interesting to think about when I get attached to my work and
          when I don’t. I think I learned it the best during my summer
          internship. I got attached when I worked. I detached myself when I had
          to step back and review my work. It’s a difficult skill, but it
          definitely helps.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          This project was research-focused, but it’s fair to say one only gets
          more inquisitive about an area of study after a period of intensive
          research. I wanted to spend more time exploring the possibilities of
          making the kind of work I was researching about. This project was an
          adrenaline ride for me. Too little time, tight constraints, yet far
          too many ideas I wanted to capture.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          To be a designer you need skill, no doubt, but also a ton of
          enthusiasm. Self-initiated projects are one of the best ways to
          showcase both. A day spent on the coding experiments for expressive
          typography in static, temporal and interactive media opened up a lot
          of possibilities. I put together an online sandbox to share these with
          my peers and let them interact and express.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          I had a lot of fun designing the cover of my book. Using one of my
          sketches “drawing with type”, I took a pen tablet and started doodling
          shapes to express what I felt transmedia typography would look like.
          The neon colours of the text and muted background evoked the perfect
          futuristic feel. The future is digital, expressive and a storm of type
          we’ll walk in everyday.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Printing your work is always the fun part. I personally love the
          entire process of putting together my artwork for the book and getting
          it print-ready. Some of my learnings in the internship helped me keep
          necessary key points in mind while setting up my document.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          With my book freshly printed out, I touched the pages, smelled the
          soft, smooth paper and held it close. There’s something magical about
          seeing your work on paper. Nothing beats this phase of any print
          project.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          During the times when designers quibble over whether design is about
          function or aesthetics, I figure sometimes the function could itself
          be to kindle an emotion. And this is where I see design merge into
          art. Like the Rainbow Rowell quote,
          <em class="i"
            >“She never looked nice. She looked like art, and art wasn’t
            supposed to look nice; it was supposed to make you feel
            somethings”</em
          >. This, to me, is the essence of expressive typography.
