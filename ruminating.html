          My journey from Srishti to Gramener
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          About two years ago, as any freshly-minted design grad out of a
          Masterâ€™s program, I interviewed with various design firms and
          consultancies. Srishti has a fairly strong network of practitioners
          and companies who regularly dip into the graduate pool looking for
          candidates. Following through on one of these referrals connected me
          to Richie from Gramener. Richie and I spoke at length â€” about
          Gramener, about my work, about the work done by Storylabs, and the
          exciting things they have been exploring in the space of data
          storytelling. Though we both had our questions around how my specific
          skillset would best fit into a small research team, we took the plunge
          and I joined Storylabs in June of 2019.
        </p>

          Skipping to two years ahead
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Itâ€™s been two years now; Iâ€™ve grown from a beady-eyed novice to a
          bespectacled information designer with a body of work to call my own.
          Storylabs has grown as well â€” in our search for ever more effective
          ways to communicate insights with clarity and panache, we have
          explored various flavors of data storytelling from comics and
          interactive narratives to data art and other non-traditional
          visualisation techniques. In these two years, Iâ€™ve had the opportunity
          to research storytelling methodologies, formulate them as tools &
          frameworks, and author data stories as examples.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          As I reflect back on my work, there are a few common strands that
          thread through every piece.
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
              Storytelling with data is a nascent field and has many
              under-explored avenues. Interactive formats in particular are
              fertile grounds, especially for stories that require exploration
              and drilling down for details (see Pandemic PandÃ¦monium, Who will
              America Vote for? and Coral Reefs are Dying). Another angle has
              been introducing comics to bring a human touch to data (Our
              Fattening World and For the Love of Numbers). Finally, thereâ€™s the
              odd-ball physical visualisations like in Letâ€™s Put a Pin on It for
              those times when you really want to dial up engagement to eleven.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
              Why should all data visualisations look the same or take a
              thousand lines of code to make? There is a twin opportunity here â€”
              expanding the horizon of what constitutes data visualisations and
              who gets to make it. Under the banner of data art, weâ€™ve designed
              tools for reducing the barriers to creating non-traditional forms
              of datavis. Joyful Data aims to be an intuitive tool for creating
              beautiful data-driven graphics, while Data Imprint pushes the idea
              of using data to create personalised art.
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
              Iâ€™ve also actively continued to pursue my interests in creative
              coding and generative art. Whether thatâ€™s making daily sketches,
              noodling around with a pen plotter, or teaching generative design,
              more often than not, these techniques have found a way to be
              useful in my work. Connecting seemingly unrelated fields might be
              the best way to discover new ideas. The tools & processes involved
              in creative coding have proved to be more valuable for me beyond
              only making art.
            </p>

            >Good people are worth their weight in rhodium.</strong
          >
          More than anything else, Storylabs has given me the enormous fortune
          to work with Richie & S Anand. Richie took a bet on me when he hired
          me into the team. He has an unbeatable ability to find and bring out
          the best in others â€” for that, Iâ€™ll always be grateful. Anand is
          always bubbling with ideas and is a constant source of inspiration
          (sometimes too much to keep up with ðŸ˜ƒ). The patience with which he
          listens to others and his ability to simplify an idea down to its
          essence is something worth emulating.
        </p>

          <strong class="b fw5"
            >Being able to write small snippets of code still continues to pay
            as a designer.</strong
          >
          The hardest part has been to stay true to what James Hague aptly calls
          programming without being overwhelmed by and obsessed with
          programming. Sticking to simple tools and languages has helped take
          out some of the anxiety associated with programming for me â€” p5.js,
          Tachyons, and AlpineJS have become dear friends. I, as a designer,
          write programs to communicate an idea, not to build empires with code.
          And thatâ€™s enough.
        </p>

          <strong class="b fw5"
            >Design is more than making pretty pictures.</strong
          >
          Thereâ€™s a certain view of designers in the industry as the people who
          sling photoshop around beautifying the world. Though Srishti never put
          us in a box, itâ€™s easy to subconsciously absorb those notions or face
          them when working with others. Truth be told, at the right place,
          designers make great glue in an organisation â€” we are creators,
          connectors, communicators. At Storylabs, my work varies from
          researching new techniques one day to consulting, teaching, and
          writing the next. Be open to adapt to the needs of a small team and
          ready to learn as you go.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Itâ€™s been an uphill ride to find my way into the world of data,
          design, and research. Some of it has been challenging, some fun, but
          almost all of it has been worthwhile.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">So, where do we go from here?</p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">Onward.</p>
