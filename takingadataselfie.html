          <strong class="b coralred fw6">Intent.</strong> Block print in a

          patterns about self-reported characteristics of an audience through a
          fun, engaging exercise.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <strong class="b coralred fw6">Data collection.</strong> The audience
          was posed with a series of simple, light-hearted questions aimed at
          eliciting their personality. For example, some of the questions were:
          Are you a tea or coffee person? Do you use an iPhone or an Android
          phone? Do you write straight or slanted? For each question, the
          possible answers were encoded in physical stamps for the audience to
          use.
        </p>

        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <strong class="b coralred fw6">Iconography.</strong> The custom stamps
          were designed to be as intuitive and iconic as possible. For instance,
          to distinguish iOS and Android phones, a simple phone icon was
          designed with a single home button to represent iOS and three home
          buttons to represent Android.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <strong class="b coralred fw6">Color.</strong> The first question
          asked to the audience was designed to bucket them into two categories,
          people who enjoy company or people who prefer their own corner. The
          color of the stamp pads used by the audience was decided based on the
          answer to this question.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <strong class="b coralred fw6">Tags.</strong> Given the large number
          of stamps, we found it useful to attach tags to each each stamp
          clearly indication its icon to help the audience find and use the
          stamps corresponding to their choice.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <strong class="b coralred fw6">The canvas.</strong>Â A large canvas was
          installed along with instructions, the answer stamps and stamp pads.
          The canvas was sectioned into grids for use by the audience. One grid
          consisted of 10 cells, one for each question. As the audience went
          through the questions, they picked up the stamps corresponding to
          their answers and left their imprint on the corresponding cell.

        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          As the answers were collected, the canvas evolved into a portrait
          representing the diverse personality of the audience. While the final
          piece qualifies as data art, it also provides us a picture with common
          patterns depicting the audience. Some of the interesting patterns
          observed were:

          <li>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">

          Learnings from the experience
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Some members of the audience observed that, this may be a good
          exercise to collect data during user experience research.
          Particularly, the use of a collective physical space to engage an
          audience would be more effective than rote form filling.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f3 f2-ns lh-title fw5 mt4 mt5-ns mb0 black-80">
          Design learnings
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Some members of the audience had difficulty in establishing a reading
          order in the instructions. Some read the questions left to right,
          while others read them top to bottom. It would be better next time to
          improve the readability of the instructions and establish a consistent
          format between the questions and the answer grid.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Some members skipped through the instructions and jump straight into
          stamping. A manual intervention was necessary from our side to ensure
          the audience fully comprehended the process. It would be valuable to
          condense the instructions to encourage more people to read it before
          starting.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Even though the stamps were tagged and organized, the audience was not
          sufficiently incentivised to place the stamps back in their respective
          slots. Perhaps, this could be made an explicit part of the process or
          explore a different arrangement (such as hanging the stamps) which
          would minimise the chaos.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          The stamps themselves are not sufficiently rugged to be reused in the
          long run. We should explore better materials for the stamp or prepare
          accordingly.
