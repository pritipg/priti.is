          <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
            I was lucky to have an early start in the Arts, beginning my study
            of Carnatic music and Bharatanatyam at the age of three. My
            instructions began simply with the basics of motion, gesture and
            emoting, but over the years I progressed to an advanced
            practitioner.
          </p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
            I had my first formal performance at the age of 8, and since then
            have continued to practice and perform throughout the years.
          </p>
          <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
            As a practising artist, I have developed a deep appreciation of the
            language of dance, a nuanced understanding of how music both leads
            and follows in a performance and a wide knowledge of Indian
            mythology, culture and traditions. Having studied under a classical
            lineage of <em class="i">guru-shishya parampara</em>, I was taught
            to place an emphasis on the freedom on expression art offers, while
            also inculcating a sense of ethical responsibility in exercising
            that freedom.

            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
              I studied Computer Science in college, partly out of an interest
              in the subject and partly because I wanted to keep a strict
              separation between my art life and my professional life. Over four
              years of the bachelor’s degree, I learned to get comfortable with
              picking up technical skills and exploring topics that have come to
              control our everyday life: from artificial intelligence and
              computer vision to advanced topics in programming.
            </p>
            <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
              This phase, while offering me pockets of topics I was interested
              in, did not give me a clear sense of what my working life would be
              like. I felt some aspects of creativity missing and I craved to
              find an avenue to express myself.

          First taste of the real world
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Post my studies, I was placed as an engineer in Wipro and shifted from
          Chennai to Bangalore. A number of things changed for me at this point:
          I could pursue the beginnings of an independent life in a new city, I
          made new friends and started to explore various professions. At Wipro,
          I was quickly put in a position of responsibility, and learned that I
          was good at coordinating and managing things in a small group of
          people. I found this unexpected as I never see myself as someone
          comfortable with meeting and managing people everyday.
        </p>
        <img class="w-100" src="/assets/writings/reflection/03.png" />
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          When the time came for us to be separated into projects, I was offered
          to work in a long-term project in Hyderabad. At this point I needed to
          make a decision, particularly because the project required a bond from
          the employees. Seeing that my programming skills were not sufficient
          at this point and a corporate environment would lack the kind of
          learning and growth I saw for myself, I made the difficult choice of
          quitting the company.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f3 f2-ns lh-title fw5 mt4 mt5-ns mb0 black-80">
          Geeking it out
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          I joined Geekskool, a three-month programming bootcamp, right after
          leaving Wipro. I was looking for that missing disconnect between the
          technical and the creative world. I felt my programming skills were
          not up to par and spent a significant portion of my time learning to
          get better at programming. A distinction soon became clear to me:
          there were programmers who primarily worked on interfaces with a focus
          on the visual design, interaction and behaviour, and programmers who
          largely worked on managing and transforming data that powered the
          interfaces behind the screen.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Given my interest in finding something creative, I chose to focus on
          interfaces and put my energy into learning to become a frontend
          developer. Several of my projects at this point were focused on
          creating visual results with code — from a small game, a paint app and
          a polar clock, all interactive and visual applications built with
          code. I enjoyed working on these projects and saw an inkling of what I
          wanted to do as a professional here.
        </p>

        <h3 class="f3 f2-ns lh-title fw5 mt4 mt5-ns mb0 black-80">
          Back into the fray
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          After Geekskool, I joined a small startup working on an educational
          product for schools and colleges. I worked on their dashboard and
          interface, with a heavy focus on data visualization. I preferred
          working in a smaller company as there were more opportunities for me
          to learn and grow. At the same time, I started to learn more about
          visual design as a profession. While my work involved a great deal of
          working with design, the code-first approach always felt lacking to
          me. I started to make a distinction between design and art: design
          requires being able to rationalise your decisions and view them from
          the perspective of the user, while art is more free-form and focuses
          on expressing the artist’s vision. I found that I was lacking in this
          fundamental skill and that there was little scope for me in developing
          as a designer in a startup environment.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          Two observations lead me from working as a developer to seeking a
          deeper understanding of the design field. First, I wanted to learn the
          design skills that I had found lacking in my practice and second, I
          felt design as career would offer me more opportunities to engage in
          creative work. Driven by this curiosity and a resolve to fully explore
          visual design, I stepped into the next phase of my career.

          Seeking a path
        </h3>
        <img class="w-100 mv4" src="/assets/writings/reflection/05.png" />
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          After moving out from my job, I made a dedicated resolve to find the
          best design studios in the city and learn from them as much as I could
          about design. I made lists of different studios, spoke to several of
          them and interviewed as an intern. After a few weeks of trying, I
          joined Happy mcgarrybowen, a well-known design studio as an intern for
          a period of six months. I opened photoshop for the first time, learned
          about advertising and branding and packaging and saw the various roles
          and practices within the company. One of the major influencing factors
          for me was to find a good mentor who saw me as someone sincerely
          curious about the field and working hard to find my place in it. This
          experience gave me a sense of what I would like to work on in the
          future (such as identity and publication design) and what I would not
          be a great fit for (such as advertising).
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          I participated in a few projects during the time and spoke to as many
          people as I could. I discovered the various schools offering a degree
          in design and the different branches that people studied. Seeing how
          much I was fascinated by this work, I made the resolve to pursue a
          Master’s in design. I took up a short-term fine arts course at Chitra
          Kala Parishath, a reputed institution for arts. The course gave me a
          good exposure into working with various media, from clay sculpting to
          print making. The library at CKP was a fascinating place for me, with
          numerous books on design and art. I devoured these as I began to
          prepare my portfolio and ready myself to apply to design school. I
          made a list of schools I wanted to apply to and started the long road
          to applying, giving exams and presenting my portfolio.

        <h3 class="f3 f2-ns lh-title fw5 mt4 mt5-ns mb0 black-80">
          Back to school
        </h3>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          I was accepted to join the Master’s degree at Srishti in Visual
          Communication. Having worked a little in the field and prepared
          myself, I was ready to work towards building a solid foundation now.
          In the year and half so far, I have learned so much working with
          faculty I deeply admire, exploring every fringe and corner of the
          field and finding my voice within it. My projects varied from studying
          color and typography, to making books and banners, to designing
          signages and websites. I grew more confident in my use of visual
          design.

          <em class="i coralred"
            >I discovered my love for typography and type design.</em
          >
          One of the key projects in discovering this interest was the Text &
          Image studio, mentored by Kumkum Nadig. I designed a book with
          different iterations of expressing the same poem (Tolkien’s I Sit and
          Think) by breaking down and combining different elements of design.
          This project clearly portrayed the expressive power of type to me in
          print media. I participated in various typography related conferences,
          workshops, type walks and competitions and built a better
          understanding of the depth and beauty of type.
        </p>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          <em class="i coralred">I learned the skills for creative coding.</em>
          As part of my Independent Study, I took up Processing, a creative
          coding platform, popular among designers. This experience gave me the
          fundamental skills of combining code and design to create dynamic
          forms beyond static media. Processing is a fascinating project as it
          so clearly the expands the scope of what designers can build without
          burdening them with the tedium of coding from scratch. I read widely
          about transmedia typography, studied the works of designers like Saul
          Bass and Neville Brody (to name a few), and slowly understood the
          scope of programmatic, rule-driven design.
        </p>
        <div class="mv4">

        </div>
        <p class="f5 f4-ns lh-copy black-50">
          In my pre-cursor to the capstone, as part of my trans-disciplinary
          studio, I picked Transmedia Typography as my premise. This combined
          both my passion for typography and creative coding and placed it in
          the context of technology’s influence of typographic practice. This
          project in particular gave me the scope to study, experiment and
          practice typography beyond print media under the able guidance of my
          mentor Nupur Banerjee. Towards the end, I created a series of sketches
          that ranged from static, temporal to interactive use of typography.
          Due to time constraints, I couldn’t explore the depth of this field to
          its fullest extent.
